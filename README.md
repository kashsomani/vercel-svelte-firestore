# vercel-svelte-firestore
I have created this template using firestore, svelte and Vercel
To run this project, first install dependecies using yarn or npm and then run the project using vercel(highly recommended) although yarn and npm should work fine.
```shell
$ vercel dev
```
or
```shell
$ yarn dev
```
or
```shell
$ npm run dev
```
